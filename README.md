Midori (緑) is a premium, feature-rich personal finance ledger themed around modern, secure, and offline-first "Leafy Ledger" design principles. It runs entirely in the browser as a client-side Single Page Application (SPA), utilizing standard HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with local data persistence via browser `localStorage`. 

Midori fully supports:
- **Multi-currency accounts**: USD, EUR, THB, CNY, and JPY with automatic real-time conversion maths.
- **Dynamic Chart.js Analytics**: Monthly savings rates, cash flow trends, and budget category donut graphs.
- **Auto-recurring Recurrences**: Set custom bill bills or paycheck deposits with automated date fast-forward processing.
- **Offline Capabilities**: Full Progressive Web App (PWA) support.

## 🚀 Live Hosting Deployment on GitHub Pages

Because Midori is a static SPA, you can host it **100% free** on **GitHub Pages** in under 2 minutes:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository
1. Log into your account on [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Click **New** to create a new repository.
3. Name it `midori-ledger` (or any name you prefer).
4. Set the repository to **Public** and do not add a README, `.gitignore`, or license. Click **Create repository**.

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub
Open your terminal inside this project directory (`C:\Users\passa\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\finance-ledger-app`) and run the following commands:
```bash
# Initialize a local git repository
git init

# Add all project files
git add .

# Create the initial commit
git commit -m "feat: initial release of Midori ledger PWA"

# Branch rename to main
git branch -M main

# Link to your newly created GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/midori-ledger.git

# Push the code to the main branch
git push -u origin main
```
*(Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username).*

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com and click the **Settings** tab.
2. In the left sidebar under the "Code and automation" section, click **Pages**.
3. Under the **Build and deployment** section, select **Deploy from a branch** in the Source dropdown.
4. Under **Branch**, choose `main` and set the folder to `/ (root)`.
5. Click **Save**.

Within 1 minute, GitHub will generate a public URL for your ledger, typically:
`https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/midori-ledger/`
